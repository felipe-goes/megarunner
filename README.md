# MEGARUNNER with SGDK

This is a repository for study purporses. This was made following the [tutorial
from OHSAT GAMES](https://www.ohsat.com/tutorial/megapong/megapong-1/). There
you can have the complete tutorial with everything you need.

You will find here a `CMakeLists.txt`, that was created with the only purpose
of making my *NeoVim* development environment work well, and a `.clang-format`
file to automate code formmatting.
